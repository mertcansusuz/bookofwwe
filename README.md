## Book of WWE 
This is one of my web works, written by [web2Py](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web2py) - Python Web Framework.
Basically, this website providing information about WWE stars, latest news, PPVs etc .At the same time; you can be a member and participate in discussions on the forum page.

web2py is using the Model View Controller ([MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller))  pattern. web2py separates the data representation (the model) from the data presentation (the view) and also from the application logic and workflow (the controller). 

### Installing
Download web2py, unzip it and then click on web2py.exe for Windows. More information [here](http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download).
After, copy the "bookofwwe" folder into "applications" folder, start the server and try.
